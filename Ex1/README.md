## Assignment

Write a program that inputs the total amount of a restaurant bill (such as 37.50) and a gratuity rate (as a whole number such as 18 to represent an 18% gratuity rate).  Compute and output the amount of the gratuity and the total bill. 

For example, if the bill is $10 and the gratuity rate is 15%, the program will output:

gratuity: $1.50

total bill: $11.50

Be sure to make all of your output look as good as possible.  Even though this is a very small, simple program, the aesthetics of the program always matters.
